The zip file contains 2 pieces of code: "data_analysis.ipynb" and 
"preprocessing_and_model_testing.ipynb". The first piece is mostly
to get a feel for the data and features, and the second piece is the model
comparison. The section headers describe roughly was is happening in
that particular section/subsection, and the comments in each
cell are either observations of the output or descriptions
of what the cell does.

The data is store on my Google drive with a shared link, for ease of
importation. I can make this link private in the future, if you wish.

The code has already been run, and the output is already printed. However,
if you would like to re-run the code, the following versions of
python packages may be necessary:

data_analysis.ipynb was run with:
python 3.9
seaborn version 0.11.2
pandas version 1.4.2
numpy version 1.22.4
matplotlib version 3.5.2

preprocessing_and_model_testing.ipynb was run with:
python 3.9
tensorflow version 2.9.1
scikit-learn version 1.1.1
xgboost 1.6.1 (less common)
